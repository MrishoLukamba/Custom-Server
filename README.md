## CUSTOM SERVER
>This is a server application made in Rust for learning purpose.
>It has the following methods (yet).
>
     1.Get -> Retrieving files and handle params but only one layer nested params.
     2.Post -> Adding files or creating files to database.
 
 But I have not implemented Posting of files, but the logic will be using curl on the client and choose any file and
 in the server I write a script to make a new file and save it.
 
 >All files will be stored in database directory
 >Pending Implementation is using implementing ssh and rsync.

**Please make any suggestion or improve anything because this is for learning purposes.**
